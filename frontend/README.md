EVENT PLANNER APP

## Overview

Welcome to the Event planner Web App! This app enables users to easily create, update, and delete events (e.g., conferences, concerts), track attendees, and view key event details such as dates, locations.

It provides an intuitive frontend interface for users to interact with and communicates with a backend server via APIs to manage event data.

## Problem Statement

Organizing and managing events can be a challenging and time-consuming task, especially when handling large groups. Many individuals and organizations face difficulties in keeping track of events, attendee lists, and event details, leading to inefficiencies. This web app provides a centralized platform to streamline the event management process, making it easier to organize, update, and communicate event information.

## Solution Statement
This application allows users to:

Create, update, and delete events.
View a list of all events.
Track attendees and event details (date, location).
In the future, we plan to support user feedback through event comments and additional features such as event RSVPs and email notifications for attendees.
